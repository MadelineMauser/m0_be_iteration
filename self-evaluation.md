# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
*I feel confident in my ability to use the each method.*

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
*It wasn't too much of a struggle because I felt I had a solid grasp on the other concepts, and it was very satisfying to pull from what I learned previously.*

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
*I could practice more with calling different methods. I could look at the Ruby documentation on my own time and tinker around.*

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
*I don't have questions at the moment, but I will ask Google and my classmates for my help if needed.*
